#Description for project 3, Work with yitizhan

I found that there is a bug (in 'search' method) in both BST.py and AVL.py, and bugs are fixed now and everything are functional. Finally I use 'plotter.py' to make a dot graph about the running time of both method. The blue line is for BST.py and the red line is or AVL.py.
